Looks like the power of holy water and a classical hammer punch in the head are the things that can defeat you - and there you are, fallen. Your bones crushed, your spirit broken. You can feel your soul fleeting away somewhere - not up, not down. Perhaps just disappearing, like everything in life eventually disappears as if it never existed. Time passes by and once well known Brunhilda is now but a long forgotten dust."
