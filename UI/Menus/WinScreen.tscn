You can see his eyes - once so proud, now lifeless and empty just like yours. But strangely you don't feel any satisfaction. The revenge has been fulfilled and yet - you are not content. The throne will never be yours, the life once stolen will never come back. Dream of retribution kept you awake, and now? Now you just turn around and walk back to the crypt. Its darkness makes you sleepy, the coldness makes you shiver. Eventually you fall asleep and never wake up again."
