However the fate, or rather your uncle, decided that the sun will never rise. It was the day of the coronation - your breakfast was poisoned and soon your young, beautiful body was hidden deep in the coldness of the crypt. But instead of, how they say, rest in peace, you woke up in the darkness with only one feeling, deeper  and stronger than anything you felt through your whole life - the urge of revenge. And with that revenge sparkling brightly in your dead eyes you left the crypt to collect the heads of those who buried your dreams. You want to reach the castle and decapitate the greatest traitor - your uncle, the high priest Theodor."
